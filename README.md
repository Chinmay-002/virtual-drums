# virtual-drums

This project uses OpenCV, numpy, and pygame to create a virtual drum set, or air drums. 
Virtual instruments are displayed on the screen. 
Using Computer Vision to detect the color of objects in relevant regions on the screen, the program plays sounds corresponding to the instruments on the screen where the colored object makes contact with the virtual instrument. 
The model is currently preset to detect a red object on the instruments.
